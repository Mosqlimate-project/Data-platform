# Model Registry API 
The model registry is a tool for registering forecasting models that want to share their  predictions in the Mosqlimate platform.

As with everything in our API, the model registry can be accessed programatically. You can send [insert new models](https://api.mosqlimate.org/docs/registry/POST/models/) in the platform, or [post predictions](https://api.mosqlimate.org/docs/registry/POST/predictions/) generated from a registered model.

Posted predictions will be available for visualization alongside data, in our platforms dashboard.
