# Welcome to the Mosqlimate API documentation
The Mosqlimate API is focused on providing automatable  access to both Data and 
Forecasting models for arbovirus diseases. 

## Data 
The Data access part of it, also called [datastore](https://api.mosqlimate.org/docs/datastore/),
gives access to Disease notification data, relevant climate time series, such as
temperature and precipitation, and Mosquito abundance data. The *geographical
scope* of the API is Brazil, at the level of municipality.

## Models
The model part of the API, is called [Model  Registry](https://api.mosqlimate.org/docs/registry/),
and it allows registered users to upload metadata about open-source forecasting
models that use Mosqlimate data. So this part of the API also works for uploading
information. Another kind of information that can be uploaded here, are the
forecasts generated by the models. The Forecasts uploaded are used to populate
our forecasting dashboard, where the models can be visually compared in their
ability to forecast dengue and similar diseases.

## Usage
Detailed usage instructions with code examples can be found in the specific
documentation of each of the API endpoint. For some of the operations, it is
necessary to register at the platform. We encourage all users to register anyway
so that we can have an idea of who is using the platform, so that we improve the
service in the future.
